## Motivation

There already exists a long list of file transfer tools (see [Related Efforts](#related-efforts)), so why bother
building another one? The problem I had with the existing tools is that they rely on
a [limited set of](https://github.com/schollz/croc/issues/289) [servers](https://magic-wormhole.readthedocs.io/en/latest/welcome.html#relays)
to orchestrate peer matching and data relaying which poses a centralisation concern. Many of the usual centralisation
vs. decentralisation arguments apply here, e.g. the servers are single points of failures, the service operator has the
power over whom to serve and whom not, etc. Further, as
this [recent issue in croc](https://github.com/schollz/croc/issues/289) shows, this is a real risk for sustainable
operation of the provided service. Only because a benevolent big player jumps in as a sponsor the service continues to
exist.

## Description

`pcp` leverages the peer-to-peer networking stack of [libp2p](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p). It uses multicast
DNS to find peers locally and the distributed hash table of IPFS for remote peer discovery. The `identify` discovery
mechanism serves the same role as `STUN`, but without the need for a set of `STUN` servers. The libp2p `Circuit Relay`
protocol allows peers to communicate indirectly via a helpful intermediary peer that is found via the DHT. This replaces
dedicated `TURN` servers.

Of course there are some significant drawbacks with this approach: It's slower than established centralised methods if
you want to transmit data over network boundaries. A DHT query to find your peer can take 2 - 3 minutes.

## Usage

The sending peer runs:

```shell
$ pcp send my_file
Code is:  bubble-enemy-result-increase
On the other machine run:
	pcp receive bubble-enemy-result-increase
```

The receiving peer runs:

```shell
$ pcp receive december-iron-old-increase
Looking for peer december-iron-old-increase...
```

If you're on different networks the lookup can take quite long without any user facing output yet (~2 - 3 minutes).

## Install

### Release download

Head over to the [releases](https://github.com/dennis-tra/pcp/releases/tag/v0.1.1) and download the latest binary for
your platform.

### From source

For now, you need to compile it yourself:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/dennis-tra/pcp.git
```

Navigate into the `pcp` folder and run:

```shell
go install cmd/pcp/pcp.go
```

Make sure the `$GOPATH/bin` is in your `PATH` variable to access the installed `pcp` executable.

### Package managers

It's on the roadmap to distribute `pcp` via `apt`, `yum`, `brew`, `scoop` and more ...

## Development

### Protobuf definitions

First install the protoc compiler:

```shell
make tools # downloads gofumpt and protoc
make proto # generates protobuf
```

The current proto definitions were generated with `libprotoc 3.14.0`.

## Feature Roadmap

Shamelessly copied from `croc`:

- [x] Two computers on the same network can exchange files
- [ ] Two computers on the same network can exchange directories
- [ ] allows any two computers to transfer data (using a relay)
- [ ] provides end-to-end encryption (using PAKE)
- [ ] enables easy cross-platform transfers (Windows, Linux, Mac)
- [ ] allows multiple file transfers
- [ ] allows resuming transfers that are interrupted
- [ ] local server or port-forwarding not needed
- [ ] ipv6-first with ipv4 fallback
- [ ] can use proxy, like tor
