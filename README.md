## Motivation

There already exists a long list of file transfer tools (see [Related Efforts](#related-efforts)), so why bother
building another one? The problem I had with the existing tools is that they rely on
a [limited set of](https://github.com/schollz/croc/issues/289) [servers](https://magic-wormhole.readthedocs.io/en/latest/welcome.html#relays)
to orchestrate peer matching and data relaying which poses a centralisation concern. Many of the usual centralisation
vs. decentralisation arguments apply here, e.g. the servers are single points of failures, the service operator has the
power over whom to serve and whom not, etc. Further, as
this [recent issue in croc](https://github.com/schollz/croc/issues/289) shows, this is a real risk for sustainable
operation of the provided service.

[comment]: <> (The `identify` discovery mechanism serves the same role as `STUN`, but without the need for a set of `STUN` servers. The libp2p `Circuit Relay` protocol allows peers to communicate indirectly via a helpful intermediary peer that is found via the DHT. This replaces dedicated `TURN` servers.)

## Project Status

The tool is in a very early stage, and I'm aware of performance, usability and **security** issues. Don't use it for anything serious.
Although I criticised tools like [`magic-wormhole`](https://github.com/magic-wormhole/magic-wormhole) or [`croc`](https://github.com/schollz/croc) above, they are amazing and way more mature.

There are also drawbacks with this approach: It's slower than established centralised methods if
you want to transmit data across network boundaries. A DHT query to find your peer can easily take several minutes.
Further, the bandwidth and geographic location of a potential relaying peer is not guaranteed which can lead to long transmission times.

## How does it work?

When running `pcp send` you'll see four random words from a list of the Bitcoin improvement proposal [BIP39](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039/bip-0039-wordlists.md).
There are lists in nine different languages of 2048 words each, currently only `english` is supported.
The first word is interpreted as a channel ID in the range from 0 to 2047.
`pcp` advertises the identifier `/pcp/{unix-timestamp}/{channel-id}` in its local network via [mDNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast_DNS) and a hashed version of this string in the [DHT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table) of [IPFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterPlanetary_File_System).
The unix timestamp is the current time truncated to 5 minutes and the prefix `/pcp` is the protocol prefix.
_In the future:_ When you enter a new 5-minute interval while `pcp send` is running it advertises an updated identifier.

To receive the file your peer enters `pcp receive four-words-from-above` and `pcp` uses the first word together with the current time truncated to 5 minutes to find the sending peer in the [DHT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table) and in your local network via [mDNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast_DNS).
It also searches for an identifier of the previous 5-minute interval.
As soon as the peer is found, both do a password authenticated key exchange ([PAKE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password-authenticated_key_agreement)) to authenticate each other.
In this procedure a comparably weak password (`four-words-from-above`) gets replaced with a strong session key that is used to encrypt all future communication.
The default [TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) encryption that [libp2p](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p) provides is not sufficient in this case as we could still, in theory, talk to a wrong peer - just encrypted.

After the peer is authenticated the receiver must confirm the file transfer, and the file gets transmitted. 

## Usage

The sending peer runs:

```shell
$ pcp send my_file
Code is:  bubble-enemy-result-increase
On the other machine run:
	pcp receive bubble-enemy-result-increase
```

The receiving peer runs:

```shell
$ pcp receive bubble-enemy-result-increase
Looking for peer bubble-enemy-result-increase...
```

If you're on different networks the lookup can take quite long (~ 2-3 minutes). Currently, there is no output while both parties are working on peer discovery, so just be very patient.

## Install

### Package managers

```shell
brew install pcp
```

It's on the roadmap to also distribute `pcp` via `apt`, `yum`, `scoop` and more ...

### Release download

Head over to the [releases](https://github.com/dennis-tra/pcp/releases) and download the latest archive for
your platform.

### From source

To compile it yourself run:

```shell
go install github.com/dennis-tra/pcp/cmd/pcp@latest # Go 1.13 or higher is required
```

Make sure the `$GOPATH/bin` is in your `PATH` variable to access the installed `pcp` executable.

## Development

### Protobuf definitions

First install the protoc compiler:

```shell
make tools # downloads gofumpt and protoc
make proto # generates protobuf
```

The current proto definitions were generated with `libprotoc 3.14.0`.

## Feature Roadmap

Shamelessly copied from `croc`:

- [x] allows any two computers to transfer data (using a relay)
  - ✅ using mDNS and DHT for peer discovery and [AutoRelay](https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/circuit-relay/#autorelay) / [AutoNat](https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/nat/#autonat)
- [x] provides end-to-end encryption (using PAKE)
  - ✅ yup, it uses [`pake/v2`](https://github.com/schollz/pake/tree/v2.0.6) from `croc`
- [x] enables easy cross-platform transfers (Windows, Linux, Mac)
  - ✅ Linux <-> Mac, ❌ Windows, but it's planned!
- [x] allows multiple file transfers
  - ✅ it allows transferring directories
- [ ] allows resuming transfers that are interrupted
  - ❌ not yet
- [x] local server or port-forwarding not needed
  - ✅ thanks to [AutoNat](https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/nat/#autonat)
- [x] ipv6-first with ipv4 fallback
  - ✅ thanks to [libp2p](https://libp2p.io/)
- [ ] can use proxy, like tor
  - ❌ not yet

You can find a project plan in the [project tab](https://github.com/dennis-tra/pcp/projects/2) of this page.
Some other ideas I would love to work on include:

- [ ] browser interop via the means of [js-libp2p](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p)
- [ ] experimental decentralised NAT hole punching via DHT signaling servers - [Project Flare](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p/issues/1039)
