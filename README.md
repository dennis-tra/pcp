## Project Status & Motivation

The tool is in a very early stage and I'm aware of security, performance and usability issues. For now it works in the limited scope of transfering files in your local network. Don't use it for anything serious. There is already a very good Go implementation named [`croc`](https://github.com/schollz/croc). 

My motivation to build a new tool is to levarage the peer-to-peer networking stack that is provided by [libp2p](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p). In the future `pcp` should also enable two peers in different networks to exchange files via a relay. I'm not sure how croc chooses relay servers but I guess there is just a limited set which puts the power to a limited number of service providers and is therefore a centralization concern (if my assumption is correct). By using libp2ps [experimental autorelay](https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/circuit-relay/#autorelay) feature I think `pcp` takes another step into a more decentralized world.

## Advantages over `croc`

1. The libp2p `identify` discovery mechanism serves the same role as STUN, but without the need for a set of “STUN servers”.
2. The libp2p `Circuit Relay` protocol allows peers to communicate indirectly via a helpful intermediary peer. Replaces dedicated TURN servers.
## Install

For now, you need to compile it yourself:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/dennis-tra/pcp.git
```

Navigate into the `pcp` folder and run:

```shell
go install cmd/pcp/pcp.go
```

Make sure the `$GOPATH/bin` is in your `PATH` variable to access the installed `pcp` executable.

## Usage

The receiving peer runs:

```shell
$ pcp receive
Your identity:

	16Uiu2HAkwyP8guhAXN66rkn8BEw3SjBavUuEu4VizTHhRcu7WLxq

Waiting for peers to connect... (cancel with strg+c)
```

The sending peer runs:

```shell
$ pcp send my_file
Querying peers that are waiting to receive files...

Found the following peer(s):
[0] 16Uiu2HAkwyP8guhAXN66rkn8BEw3SjBavUuEu4VizTHhRcu7WLxq

Select the peer you want to send the file to [#,r,q,?]:
```

At this point the sender needs to select the receiving peer, who in turn needs to confirm the file transfer.

## Development

### Generate Protobuf definitions

First install the protoc compiler:

```shell
go install google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go
```

Then run from the root of this repository:

```shell
protoc -I=pkg/pb --go_out=pkg/pb --go_opt=paths=source_relative p2p.proto
```

The proto defintions were generated with `libprotoc 3.14.0`.

## Feature Roadmap

Shamelessly copied from `croc`:

- [x] Two computers on the same network can exchange files
- [ ] Two computers on the same network can exchange directories
- [ ] allows any two computers to transfer data (using a relay)
- [ ] provides end-to-end encryption (using PAKE)
- [ ] enables easy cross-platform transfers (Windows, Linux, Mac)
- [ ] allows multiple file transfers
- [ ] allows resuming transfers that are interrupted
- [ ] local server or port-forwarding not needed
- [ ] ipv6-first with ipv4 fallback
- [ ] can use proxy, like tor
